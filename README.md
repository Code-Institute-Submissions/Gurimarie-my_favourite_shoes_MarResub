# "I Love Shoes"
## A web-site where shoe-lovers may share, discuss and talk about their favourite shoes 
Looking through the public gallery is open to anyone visiting the site, but in order to contribute to the database, you need to create a user and log in.

When entering a record for a pair of shoes, you may choose for it to be public (visible to everyone), og private (only visible on your private profile-page).

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories:

### First time visitor goals
Exploring the site and getting inspired.

### Returning visitor goals
Register as a user, start to build my profile, or just get inspiration from others. Finding out if those beatiful deasigner-shoes I've dreamt about are actually comfortable to wear (or just pretty to look at), from someone who has already bought them.

### Frequent user goals
Sharing and getting followers. Perhaps promoting small shoe-brands?
May also be just for private use, keeping a record of all my shoes, to go through when I need to decide what to wear, or what I need to buy for the next season.

### Site owner goals
Get information on what shoelovers appreciate most in their shoes, and what variables should be available to choose from if the users were to design their own favourite shoes. Ultimately to create a "design-your-own-shoes"-shoe-brand.
